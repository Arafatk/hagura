title: Gsoc 2018 with Sciruby Foundation 
---

# Hi Readers, 

I have been selected as a student developer for Google Summer of Code at Scientific Ruby foundation. 
Me and Pranav Garg have been selected for the same project and we will be working on developing a potentially high impact library to do plotting in ruby. Our work will be inspired by MatplotLib. We will be mentored by Sameer Deshmukh, Pjotr Prins and John Woods from Sciruby. Now first let me answer the fundamental question.

Why Sciruby?
I have always been a math aficionado and I loved making and developing real world application that could benefit a lot of programmers. Making the lives of programmers better is something that is very satisfying for me. 

Sciruby is one of the most well known scientific computation group in Ruby that accomplishes exactly that and helps me do what I want while using my beloved Ruby language. I have had a lot of experience working with them and they seem nice. Besides this time we have taken a very ambitious project and building the project as well as the community around it is extremely important. I truly believe that Sciruby could help a lot with that. 

## What about Matplotlib?
I am extremely passionate about plotting libraries in general and I have built a plotting library for Golang before this. My goal is to use this project as a means to enable simple and seamless plotting in Ruby. Please do take a look at the [roadmap for the project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t7jJKMaPjFI7pbjfMSG7eh6YmqqIE0qEoXXqsxROlYs/edit) and let us know if you guys have any questions. 





We still have many loose ends in our proposal for the project and we would be bouncing around many ideas before we decide to go with the a choice. There are a lot of interesting things to come along this summer. Let's hope for the best. 


## About Google Summer of Code
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development. Students work with an open source organization on a 3 month programming project during their break from school.
