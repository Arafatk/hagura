title: Thoughts on Bubble Plots...
---

# Hi Readers,  
I have had a lot of fun making cool plots and designing their geometry from
scratch because it offers a lot of interesting ideas both to understand
OOP and geometry/math.   

In this blog, I would share you the whole thought process so that you too can
make plots like that.

Let's start with the textbook definition of bubble plot
*A bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data. Each
entity with its triplet (v1, v2, v3) of associated data is plotted as a disk that
expresses two of the vi values through the disk's xy location and the third
through its size.*    

Practically, we can think of Bubble plot as a visualization that helps compare
the intensity of data-points in a 2d space. For example let's look at a very classic
bubble plot

Here we have a 2-d space that shows a map of the united states and the diameter of
different circles helps us compare the population in different states. This
clearly establishes the relevance of bubble plot as a plotting mechanism that helps
compare values in a 2-d space. This idea can also be mapped to many other plotting tasks

Now that we know **why** of making bubble plots lets move to the **how** by looking
at Rubyplot codebase.

The whole bubble class code base is divided into 3 files      
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Arafatk/hagura/gh-pages/images/12.png)

**init.rb** -> Initialization the bubble class      
**draw.rb** -> Compilation of drawing functions     
**data.rb** -> Operations to get geometry information from the user data      

Overall, I have made a simple bubble class that inherits from scatter plot because
scatter plot and bubble plot are very similar at their core ideas. To get into the
inner runnings lets run some code and explore how it works.  


```
plot = Rubyplot::Bubble.new
plot.data(:apples, [-1, 19, -4, -23], [-35, 21, 23, -4], [45, 10, 21, 9])
plot.data(:peaches, [20, 30, -6, -3], [-1, 5, -27, -3], [13, 10, 20, 10])
plot.set_colors_array(%w[white yellow])
plot.write('spec/reference_images/bubble.png')
```

**This code is implemented internally in the library as ->**

Now let's walk through the codebase  
1. Initialization -> we start off initially with the setting up of
 a few default background colors, fonts etc can be set at the start.  
```
plot = Rubyplot::Bubble.new
```

2. Data Addition -> Data is added in set of three arrays
```
plot.data(:apples, [-1, 19, -4, -23], [-35, 21, 23, -4], [45, 10, 21, 9])
plot.data(:peaches, [20, 30, -6, -3], [-1, 5, -27, -3], [13, 10, 20, 10])
```      

These arrays represent the X, Y co-ordinate and the proportional circle radius
in the third array. At first there is the [spread calculation](https://github.com/Arafatk/magick-rubyplot/blob/master/lib/rubyplot/scripting/bubble/data.rb#L20) along all the arrays
to get the maximum/minimum  values for X/Y Axis and this helps to figure
out how to best give enough space to the bubbles made in the plot.
Notice that the spread calculation involves taking the maximums/minimum values
of the the arrays after doing addition/subtraction between X/Y and the
Z axis. This is because the spread the depends not only on the co-ordinates
of an individual bubble but also on the size of the bubble itself. Taking
this into account solves the problem.

3.  ```plot.set_colors_array(%w[white yellow])```  
This function just sets the colors for every single label of the graph. It's pretty
cool but it's not absolutely necessary to use this function. When the user doesn't
set this function the colors are automatically selected randomly from the list
of colors supported by RMAgick.

4. ```plot.write('spec/reference_images/bubble.png')```
Finally this function call does the whole sorcery of RubyPlot.

A. At first it sets up the [drawing](https://github.com/Arafatk/magick-rubyplot/blob/master/lib/rubyplot/artist/artist.rb#L35)
by first calculating the data spread to normalize the data and then setting up the
all the basic [geometry measurements](https://github.com/Arafatk/magick-rubyplot/blob/master/lib/rubyplot/artist/artist.rb#L46) of the graph.

B. Then it sets up  the graph pixel boundaries from
all the sides like right, top, left, bottom and it also sets the label heights
boundaries and space offsets. So until this part it makes the calculations that
will eventually make the graph.

C. The actual drawing process starts where it writes the legends, title and the axis labels.   
At this point our graph is basically empty and looks like this

D. It is then that the normalized data is finally plotted one by one in the form
of [circles on the plot]  (https://github.com/Arafatk/magick-rubyplot/blob/master/lib/rubyplot/scripting/bubble/draw.rb#L45)
the code is simple and easy to understand.

You can watch the evolution of a plot with it's data in these sequences of images

It shows how the plot is "filled up" as the loops proceeds.  On the completion
of the process we have a clean and beautiful bubble plot for our data.

*Thanks a lot for reading this story... I hope you learn something from this
and make something cool of your own.*
